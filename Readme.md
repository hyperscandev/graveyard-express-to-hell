## Thanks

- ppcasm - Initially got the whole thing started

- Bushing - RIP :( He was responsible for the hyperscan.bin firmware file being dumped originally, and a good source of valid information
- LiraNuna - Reverse engineering, and coding, etc
- Sunplus - They actually indirectly provided a lot of information and tools through other S+Core products, and at least made a very good effort to support open-source
- Mattel - Such an underappreciated system
